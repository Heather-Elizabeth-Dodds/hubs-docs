Skyboxes can significantly impact the ambience of your scene. Unless you have started from a template that removed the default elements, you should have a skybox in your scene when you begin.

The skybox properties panel lets you fine tune the existing skybox. You can change the following qualities: 

* Time of Day
* Latitude
* Luminance
* Scattering Amount
* Scattering Distance
* Horizon Start
* Horizon End

## Adding a custom skybox

It is not possible to add a custom Skybox to a scene. However, one workaround is to insert a 360 image inside of your scene to obscure the existing Skybox.
